Explanation of the Code
Connection Setup: The script uses Python's socket library to establish a persistent connection to the server.
Timing Measurement: Each guess sent to the server is timed, and the timing data helps determine if the guess is partially correct.
Incremental Guessing: The password is built incrementally, character by character. For each position, the character with the longest response time is assumed correct and added to the partial password.
Usage
Clone this repository.
Run the script with Python 3:
bash
Copy code
python3 guess_password.py
The script will display progress as it guesses each character and outputs the flag when the password is fully guessed.
Results and Takeaways
This timing-based attack successfully deduced the password and retrieved the flag within a single session, demonstrating how small timing discrepancies can leak sensitive information.

Security Implications
Timing-based attacks highlight the importance of designing systems that handle sensitive information in a constant-time manner to prevent information leakage through side channels. This challenge serves as a practical example of the risks of timing vulnerabilities and the need for constant-time comparison functions in security-sensitive applications.
